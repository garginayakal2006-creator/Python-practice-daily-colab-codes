Welcome to Gargi Nayakalâ€™s Python Practice Repository!
This repo contains my daily practice notebooks from Google Colab, where Iâ€™m learning and experimenting with Python â€” one day at a time ðŸš€
ðŸ“˜ About This Repository

ðŸ’¡ Each notebook is named as Day X.ipynb (e.g., Day 19.ipynb)

âœ¨ Every file covers one small Python concept â€” from loops, conditionals, and functions to advanced logic

ðŸ§  Created as part of my journey to strengthen Python skills for AI & Computational Physics
